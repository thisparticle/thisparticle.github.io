# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >-
  I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at [The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/). I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees with honors at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).


  My research focuses on autonomy in intelligent mobile systems, with a particular interest in perception in dynamic environments for robotic interaction. This involves robust localization in complex and degenerate scenarios, constructing detailed geometric and semantic models, scene abstraction and understanding, and lifelong learning for autonomous mapping in unfamiliar settings.
